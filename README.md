## Archived

This project is is archived. The libGDX tools have evolved into the [CoveTools](https://github.com/CypherCove/CoveTools) library, which can be used via Maven. I no longer use programmatic preferences and developed the [CovePrefs](https://github.com/CypherCove/CovePrefs) library as a traditional XML preferences replacement for the ones here.

### About
This is a set of tools I use in Cypher Cove's live wallpapers. They help with testing the live wallpaper using a desktop libGDX build. It also includes an extensive set of programatic preferences. I originally found Android's preferences to be more flexible if I avoided defining them in XML, and created these helper classes for this purpose.
